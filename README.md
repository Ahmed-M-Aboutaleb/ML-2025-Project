# Machine Learning Course Project

**California House Price Prediction**: Built a regression model using Scikit-learn to predict house prices based on numerical dataset.

**Food Recognition**: Developed a classification model using Logistic Regression and KNN to identify food categories from image data, evaluated using Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, and AUC scores.
## Features

- **Logistic regression & KNN as classifiers on an image dataset**: Utilized Logistic Regression and KNN to classify food images into predefined categories, with performance evaluated using Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, and AUC scores.
- **Linear regression & KNN as regressors on a numerical dataset**: Developed Linear Regression and KNN models to predict California house prices using key features, achieving performance evaluation.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implemented data cleaning, scaling, and transformation techniques to ensure high-quality input for both numerical and image datasets.
- **Visualization**: Visualized data distributions, model predictions, and evaluation metrics using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain deeper insights.
